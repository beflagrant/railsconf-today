Ok, we found a larger karaoke venue, [Impulse Karaoke](https://impulseloungekaraoke.com/) 4771 Britt Rd Ste E-7, Norcross, GA 30093 which is about ~20 minute drive out. We're working out transportation, but not much closer to here that opens until Thursday with private rooms.
We have two rooms for 30 people each, so a total of 60 people allowed. The official reservation is at 8PM and lasts 3 hours, but we may be able to extend at the venue, which was about the best I could negotiate on it.

They do have a dress code and a few rules, so let's make sure to follow:

<blockquote>
AGE RESTRICTION
21+ with a valid ID. NO EXCEPTIONS.

DRESS CODE ENFORCED
NO FLIP FLOPS - NO SLIDES - NO CROCS - NO GYM SHORTS - NO TANK TOPS - NO BAGGY OR SAGGY CLOTHING - NO DOO RAGS OR BANDANAS - NO OVERSIZED BAGS OR BACKPACKS - NO CLUB JACKETS OR CLUB COLORS - NO GYM WEAR - NO SLEEVELESS SHIRTS - NO SWEAT PANTS - NO SEE THROUGH CLOTHING OR BIKINI TOPS - NO WORK BOOTS

NO OUTSIDE FOOD OR ALCOHOL 
(IF OUTSIDE ALCOHOL IS FOUND YOU WILL BE PROSECUTED)

NO MARIJUANA OR SMOKING CIGARETTES INSIDE THE KARAOKE ROOM
IF WE FIND IT OR WE SMELL IT, YOU AND YOUR PARTY WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE

DAMAGE HOOKAHS
IF YOU DAMAGE A HOOKAH A REPLACEMENT FEE OF $100 WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR BILL
</blockquote>
Anyways, that should about cover details.

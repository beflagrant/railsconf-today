# {{ resource.data.title }}
Let's get out and see a bit of Atlanta at Ponce City Market! We'll be meeting up at BOTI WALLA Indian Street Food at 6pm and maybe explore THE ROOF weather permitting.


<blockquote><a href="https://www.botiwalla.com/atlanta">BOTI WALLA</a> Botiwalla is inspired by the tea and kabab houses - known as Irani cafes - of Chef Meherwan's childhood, as well as the grills - sigris - that pop up on the streets of India late at night, serving grilled meats and flatbreads to hungry revelers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LaRayiaâ€™s Bodega is a black owned natural vegan grab and go eatery serving a variety of fresh salads, cold press juices, smoothies, vegan lemonades, vegan milk teas and hot food with Caribbean international flavors.</blockquote>
